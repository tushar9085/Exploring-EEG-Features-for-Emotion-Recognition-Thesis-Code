# Exploring EEG Features for Emotion Recognition: An In-Depth Evaluation with Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches

This thesis explores emotion recognition using EEG signals by applying various machine learning and deep learning techniques. Several feature extraction methods were explored, including Statistical features, Power Spectral Density, and Differential Entropy (DE). The models tested include CNN, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN, and Random Forest, using the SEED and DEAP datasets.

Key results:
- **Random Forest**: 84% accuracy (SEED, DE features)
- **SVM**: 83.33% accuracy (SEED, DE features)
- **CNN**: 89% accuracy (SEED, DE features)
- **Hybrid CNN-BiLSTM**: 93% accuracy (SEED, DE features)
